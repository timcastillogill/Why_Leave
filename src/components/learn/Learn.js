                There are many reasons why it might be too difficult or dangerous
                for people to stay in their own countries. For example, children,
                woman and men flee from violence, war, hunger, extreme poverty,
                because of their sexual or gender orientation, or from the
                consequences of climate change or other natural disasters. Often
                people will ace a combination of these difficult circumstances.
                People who leave their countries are not always fleeing danger. They
                might believe they have a better chance of finding work in another
                country because they have the education or capital to seek
                opportunities elsewhere. Others might want to join relatives or
                friends who are already living abroad. Or they might seek to start
                or finish their education in another country. There are lots of
                different reasons for people to start a journey to build a life in a
                new country.

                <h2>What exactly is a refugee, an asylum-seeker and a migrant?</h2>
                <p>
                  The terms “refugee”, “asylum-seeker” and “migrant” are used to
                  describe people who are on the move, who have left their countries
                  and have crossed borders. The terms “migrant” and “refugee” are
                  often used interchangeably but it is important to distinguish
                  between them as there is a legal difference.
                </p>

                <h2>Who is a refugee?</h2>
                <p>
                  A refugee is a person who has fled their own country because they
                  are at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution
                  there. The risks to their safety and life were so great that they
                  felt they had no choice but to leave and seek safety outside their
                  country because their own government cannot or will not protect
                  them from those dangers. Refugees have a right to international
                  protection.

                <h2>Who is an asylum-seeker?</h2>
                <p>
                  An asylum-seeker is a person who has left their country and is
                  seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights
                  violations in another country, but who hasn’t yet been legally
                  recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on
                  their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right. This means
                  everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek
                  asylum.
                </p>

                <h2>Who is a migrant?</h2>
                <p>
                  There is no internationally accepted legal definition of a
                  migrant. Like most agencies and organizations, we at Amnesty
                  International understand migrants to be people staying outside
                  their country of origin, who are not asylum-seekers or refugees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some migrants leave their country because they want to work, study
                  or join family, for example. Others feel they must leave because
                  of poverty, political unrest, gang violence, natural disasters or
                  other erious circumstances that exist there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lots of people don’t fit the legal definition of a refugee but
                  could nevertheless be in danger if they went home.
